A DSiWare Exploit for The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Anniversary Edition
###
This was originally exploited by yellows8 so check out his repo of <a href="https://github.com/yellows8/dsi/">4swordshax</a>
This is only a stage 1 exploit since I really did this to learn about DSiWare Exploitation. if you wanted to run into the homebrew loader with this, I suggest looking at yellows8's repo.
I will update this time to time to add either some enhancements. One of them, making both screens change color.
###
## What does this do?
* Runs a stage 1 payload, thus a blue screen on your top screen of your DSi/3DS.
###
# How do I trigger the exploit?
* You don't have to. It's autoboot so just enter the app on your DSi/3DS.
